For a relativistic object, photons emitted at source frame at different locations arrive at the observer at the same time, *i. e.*,  $\mathrm{d}t_{obs}=(1-\beta\cos\theta)\mathrm{d}t_e$.

1) Consider an infinitely thin, spherical shell that moves from an origin ($r = 0$) with a constant Lorentz factor $\Gamma$. Define $t_e = 0$ and $t_{obs} = 0$ when the source is at $r_e = 0$. Derive the radius $r_e$ of the equal arrival time surface (EATS) of the photons as a function of $t_{obs}$, $\beta$ and $\theta$.

2) Plot such surface in x-y plane (where $r=(x^2+y^2)^{1/2}$  ï¼‰for $t_{obs} = 3\ \mathrm{s}$, $\Gamma=300$.

*Sol*:

We know that the transformation between relativistic ejecta emission timescale $\mathrm{d}t_e$ (in the laboratory frame) and the observed timescale $\mathrm{d}t_{obs}$ (in the observer frame). Hence, at a given observer time moment, the received photons should be radiated from different ejecta time moments, corresponding to the angle $\theta$ between ejecta radius and the sight of view.

Integrate the time and let $t_{e}=0$, $t_{obs}=0$. We have:

$$t_{e}=\frac{t_{obs}}{1-\beta\cos\theta}$$

Multiplying $\beta c$ on both side of the equation will get the radius of ejecta $r_e$ in laboratory frame where photons will arrives at the observer simultaneously, *i.e*, EATS.

$$r_e\equiv \beta c t_e = \frac{\beta c t_{obs}}{1-\beta\cos\theta}$$

If $\Gamma=300$, then $\beta = \sqrt{1-1/\Gamma^2}$ and let $t_{obs}=3\ \mathrm{s}$. We have the radius of the infinitely thin ejecta $\frac{r_e}{c}$ to be:
