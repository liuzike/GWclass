__Derive the GW frequency before coalesce of a binary system__

From the lecture slide, we've known the total energy radiated by GW is:

$$L_{\rm GW}=\frac{32}{5}\frac{c^5}{G}\left(\frac{GM_c\omega_{gw}}{2c^3}\right)^\frac{10}{3}f(e)=\frac{32}{5}\frac{c^5}{G}\left(\frac{G^5\mu^2M^3}{c^{10}a^5}\right)f(e)$$

And this is the dominant mechanism for a binary system to lose its orbiting energy before coalesce, _i.e._ :

$$\frac{dE}{dt}=-L_{\rm GW}$$

We also know the orbiting energy is $E=-\frac{G\mu M}{2a}$. Hence, by using the second format of $L_{GW}$, we have:

$$\frac{da}{dt}=-\frac{64}{5}\frac{G^3}{c^5}\frac{\mu M^2}{a^3}f(e)$$

Integrate both side of the equation, and define $\tau=t_0-t$ to be the time before coalesce. We will then have $a=0$ when $\tau=0$, thus:

$$a^4=\frac{256}{5}\frac{G^3\mu M^2}{c^5}\tau$$

Substitute semi major axis $a$ by $\omega_{gw}$ using the first format of $L_{GW}$ and $M_c=\mu^\frac{3}{5}M^\frac{2}{5}$ by definition:

$$\omega_{gw}=\frac{2G^\frac{1}{2}M^\frac{1}{2}}{a^\frac{3}{2}}$$

Finally, the frequency of the radiated GW of a binary system at time $\tau$ before coalesce should be :

$$f_{gw}(\tau) = \frac{\omega_{gw}(\tau)}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{\pi} G^\frac{1}{2}M^\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{256}{5}\frac{G^3\mu M^2}{c^5}\tau\right)^{-\frac{3}{8}} = \frac{1}{\pi} \left(\frac{5}{256}\frac{1}{\tau}\right)^\frac{3}{8} \left(\frac{GM_c}{c^3}\right)^{-\frac{5}{8}}$$

By using typical astronomical constants, we have:

$$f_{gw}(\tau) = 134.07632{\rm Hz}\left(\frac{M_c}{1.21M_\odot}\right)^{-\frac{5}{8}}\left(\frac{\tau}{1{\rm s}}\right)^{-\frac{3}{8}}$$
